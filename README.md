## Welcome to Chickenn00dle's Image Search Microservice

Replace the URL params with your own search query and behold! Your images, or rather their urls and other such data, will appear in JSON format.

For example, to perform a search on Bruce Lee, limiting your results to 5 entries use the following url:

https://noodles-img-search.glitch.me/search/bruce%20lee?offset=5

You can find a list of previous search terms in JSON format with the following url:

https://noodles-img-search.glitch.me/recent/

IMPORTANT!

Please replace any spaces in your URL with %20.
